# EcoBoard
EcoBoard is new microcontroler based on the processor ATSAMD21G18 ARM Cortex M0 at 48Mhz with 3V3 logic, as the Arduino Zero.
The chip has 256K of FLASH and 32K of RAM. It's fully compatible with Arduino and Adafruit libraries.

(The board is not available yet)

We add several useful features
* 1Kb EEPROM
* A MicroSD card
* A Real Time Clock
* 5V Output
* GPIO Port Expander (P0-P4 outpouts and P5 & P6 are connected to a LED (D5 & D6)
* A I2C connector
* A UART connector
* A 1-Wire connector
* A debuger/programmer connector
* A reset buton
* A programable buton
* A switch ON/OFF Button

## Examples
We provide several [examples](https://github.com/ecosensors/Ecoboard/tree/master/examples) to quickly start with the EcoBoard. All examples are done for the EcoBoard, but you can easly use it for other Arduino board, with may be, a few modification as the pin definition. Note, the examples are basic and you will probabely improve it for your application. Feel you free to propose correction or improvement, scpecialy if you noticed some errors, or a better way to use the examples. 
(More examples will be added soon)

The board will be available beginning of August 2020, with exemples of Arduino code to easly first use it.

### Header J6 (programmation)
You can use Header J6 to program/debug the ATSAMD21G18 chips. we use it only to flash the boot loader. More info can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/programming-an-m0-using-an-arduino/overview)
Pin | Output
--- | ---
1 | GND
2 | 3V3
3 | SWCLK
4 | SWDIO

6 | NC

You ma yhave to close the jumper SJ5 to connect pin5 to pin40 of the AZSAMD21G18 (RESET)

### Header J7
J7 is connected to P4 and to A5.
You can use it as 1Wire bus. I am used to connected a DS18B20 sensor (Waterproof temperature sensor). P4 power it when a measure is needed and A5 read the measure

### Header J8 (OLED)
Pin | Output
--- | ---
1 | GND
2 | 3V3
3 | SCL
4 | SDA

### Jumpers
**SJ1 (5V converter)** If you do not need 5V output, you can close SJ2 to disable the TPS6109

**SJ2 (ARef)** Normally the reference voltage is the same as the chip logic voltage (3.3V) but if you need an alternative analog reference. Can't go higher than 3.3V!

For the EcoBoard as for all MO boards, close the SJ2 jumber and add the following in setup()

```
#if defined(ARDUINO_SAMD_ZERO) || defined(__arm__)
    analogReadResolution(10);
    analogReference(AR_EXTERNAL);
#endif
```

**SJ3 & SJ4 (I2C pullup)**
SJ3 and SJ4 are I2C pull up. Both jumpers have to be closed, excepted if SCL and SDA are pull up from another devise.

**SJ5**
SJ5 must be open, excepted if you need to programm the ATSAMD21G18 ARM Cortex M0

## SD Card 
We add an SD card to log the EcoBoard activity or to save some parameters or other values. The MicroSD card is not provided with the board

Example is coming soon ...

## RTC (Real Time Clock) & Low Power
The Real Time Clock is working with the DS3231 chip. The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C real-time clock (RTC) with an integrated temperature compensated. You will need a **CR1225** cell coin battery.
The EcoBoard can be programmed to sleep in order to save cunsomption.

See some examples [here](https://github.com/ecosensors/Ecoboard/blob/master/examples/rtc-lowpower/rtc-lowpower.ino)

## EEPROM
EcoBoard has a 64KB EEPROM  (74LC64) to store relatively small amounts of data as keys or parameters

See simple example [here](https://github.com/ecosensors/Ecoboard/tree/master/examples/eeprom)

## 1-Wire & GPIO expander port
### GPIO I/O expander port
EcoBoard allow you to use 6 additonal GPIO with the PCF8574 ([Datasheeet](https://www.ti.com/product/PCF8574) ). The outputs P1 to P6, will allow you to control the status of another device or an LED. However, the outputs can only provide 25mA. In some cases, this power may not be sufficient. It's the reason why, we added three MOSFET-P (IRML2244) on the outputs P1, P2 and P3. Thus, the outputs P1, P2 and P3 of the J3 connector can now supply up to 500mA. The P3, P5 and P6 outputs depend on the PCF8574.

P4 is used to power the 1-Wire sensor

See example [here](https://github.com/ecosensors/Ecoboard/blob/master/examples/expander-1wire/expander-1wire.ino#L76)


### 1-Wire (DS18B20)
In the example, we will show you how to prepare and use a Waterproof temperature sensor (DS18B20) working with 1-Wire bus.
If you want to use a 1-Wire sensor, you can use the J7 connector. You need to enable the GPIO port expander. J7 is connected to P4 and a A5. We use P4 to power the DS18B20 when we need to take a mesure and the mesure is done through A5. Exemple will follow soon.

#### Connection
Red wire => 3V3
Blue wire => GND
Yellow wire => read

### Arduino

See example [here](https://github.com/ecosensors/Ecoboard/blob/master/examples/expander-1wire/expander-1wire.ino#L117)

Resum√©:
```
#include <OneWire.h>                // Include for 1-Wire sensor
#define P4 4 // pin P4              // To power 1-Wire sensor before reading
const byte ONEWIRE_READ = 19;       // (19 = A5)  To read 1-Wire sensor
// See more in the example
```
