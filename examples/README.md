## Information about the example files

Those examples are published for informational purposes only and no warranty is given as to its suitability for your environment. However, as we are permanetly working on the board to improvement it, the script will be updated and improved following **your** needs.

The examples are fine to help you to start with a minium of kills and curiosity, either with our board or with any Arduino compatible boards. For instance, if you are not using a PCF9574, you need a minimum of curiosity to adapt the script, or to use the right output following your needs and sensors :)


All of the examples have been tested with the EcoSensors board.
