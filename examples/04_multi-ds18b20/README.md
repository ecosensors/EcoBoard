# ECOBOARD - Multi DS18B20

I have not reviewed thie example script for the EcoBoars, but I will update it in a near future.
We a litle bit of curiosity, you can easely use the script as it is. Feel free to send improvement ;)

The script is distributed WITHOUT WARRANTY

With EcoBoard, you can work up to 4 DS18B20 sensors connected to J1 to J4. Each sensor signal will be read by A1, A2, A3 and A4.

You can check the [EcoDs18b20 library](https://github.com/ecosensors/EcoDs18b20), as well.
